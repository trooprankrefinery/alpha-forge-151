## Agentic LLM Intelligence Layer

### From language to governed alpha.

The platform treats language as a first-class market data substrate.

Filings, earnings calls, macro commentary, news, transcripts, social narratives,
central-bank language, analyst revisions, and event-driven text are converted
into structured text-event-v2 features. These features are not uncontrolled LLM
outputs. They are manifest-bound, versioned, evaluated, audited, and
promotion-gated before they can influence a portfolio.

At the center is a governed multi-agent intelligence layer: a swarm of
specialized AI agents that reason over market context, challenge hypotheses,
inspect risks, and prepare candidate signals for quantitative validation.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Agent Console</strong> &mdash; specialized intelligence roles</summary>

| Agent | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Market Oracle | Converts market events, regime changes, and narrative shifts into structured research hypotheses |
| Sentiment Synthesizer | Extracts sentiment, uncertainty, surprise, and directional pressure from noisy language streams |
| Strategy Debater | Runs adversarial critique against candidate alpha ideas before they reach formal research |
| Risk Guardian | Detects overfitting, regime fragility, crowding, stale data, and hidden exposure |
| Evidence Auditor | Checks whether a signal has enough statistical and operational support for promotion |
| Execution Examiner | Reviews whether a strategy can survive cash, liquidity, broker, and order-routing constraints |

</details>

This is not &ldquo;prompt engineering.&rdquo;

It is governed machine reasoning for alpha research: agent outputs are
traceable, reproducible, inspected, and connected to downstream evidence.

## Text-Event-v2

### LLM-native alpha, engineered for production.

The text-event-v2 family turns unstructured language into quantitative features
that can be ranked, backtested, stress-tested, and governed like any other alpha
source.

It supports:

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Text-Event Capability Matrix</strong> &mdash; LLM-native features under governance</summary>

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Event Extraction | Converts raw text into structured market events, catalysts, risks, and directional hypotheses |
| Narrative Regime Detection | Tracks shifts in market language, macro tone, risk appetite, and sector-level narratives |
| Filing Intelligence | Extracts management tone, uncertainty, litigation risk, guidance changes, and operating pressure |
| Earnings Call Reasoning | Identifies surprise, confidence, hedging language, and forward-looking signal changes |
| Manifest-Governed Features | Every LLM-derived feature is tied to a schema, prompt contract, model version, and audit trail |
| Live Startup Assertions | Production startup fails if text models, manifests, or required feature contracts are missing or inconsistent |
| Promotion Readiness | Text-derived signals must survive the same evidence pipeline as price, fundamental, or microstructure features |

</details>

The result is a language intelligence layer that behaves less like a chatbot
and more like a governed research instrument.

---

## Hybrid ML + Representation Learning Engine

### Classical alpha, modern ML, and learned structure &mdash; in one research graph.

The research engine combines traditional quantitative signals with machine
learning and learned representations across the full feature universe.

It integrates:

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Feature Universe</strong> &mdash; explicit domain knowledge plus learned structure</summary>

| Feature / Model Family | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Price & Momentum Features | Trend, reversal, volatility, distance-to-high, and cross-sectional ranking signals |
| Microstructure-v3 | Liquidity, spread, volume pressure, intraday behavior, and trading-friction-aware features |
| Ownership-v1 | Institutional behavior, positioning shifts, insider activity, and ownership structure |
| Estimates-v1 | Analyst expectations, revisions, dispersion, and forward-looking earnings pressure |
| Options-v1 | Volatility surface, skew, flow, and implied market expectation signals |
| Macro-v1 | Rate, inflation, liquidity, sector, and broad regime context |
| Formulaic Alpha Mining | Evolutionary search over WorldQuant-style grammars with auto-promotion constraints |
| Learned Representations-v1 | PCA-style embeddings and compressed cross-family structure from existing features |
| Text-Event-v2 | LLM-derived structured features from filings, calls, news, and narrative sources |
| XGBoost Ranking Pipelines | Nonlinear interaction discovery, cross-sectional scoring, and feature attribution |

</details>

This creates a research system that can discover alpha from both explicit domain
knowledge and latent structure hidden across feature families.

The platform does not rely on one model, one signal, or one narrative. It builds
an ensemble of evidence.

---

## Autonomous Research Factory

### Alpha discovery with memory, discipline, and promotion control.

Quant Platform is designed as an autonomous research factory: generate
hypotheses, build features, run experiments, evaluate results, preserve
artifacts, and promote only what survives.

The research loop is structured:

```text
Hypothesis -> Feature Family -> Campaign -> Walk-Forward Validation -> Diagnostics -> Evidence Package -> Promotion Decision
```

Each experiment produces reproducible artifacts: feature manifests, model
configs, fold results, IC diagnostics, bootstrap checks, turnover profiles,
drawdown curves, and production-candidate reports.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Research Diagnostics</strong> &mdash; how attractive illusions are rejected</summary>

| Research Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Campaign-Based Research | Experiments are organized as campaigns instead of ad hoc notebooks |
| Walk-Forward Validation | Strategies are tested across rolling out-of-sample folds |
| IC Diagnostics | Signal quality is measured through rank correlation, stability, and negative-streak behavior |
| Bootstrap Evidence | Statistical uncertainty is measured before promotion |
| Turnover Analysis | Execution drag and capacity pressure are treated as first-class constraints |
| Regime Testing | Performance is analyzed across risk-on, risk-off, volatile, and low-liquidity periods |
| Production-Candidate Reports | Strategies are packaged with the evidence needed for governed deployment |

</details>

The system is built to reject attractive illusions: high-return backtests,
fragile edges, accidental leakage, unstable IC, and strategies that look good
only before costs.

---

## V2 Shared-Account Orchestrator

### Many engines. One account. One coherent portfolio.

Real trading is not a collection of independent strategy demos. Multiple
engines compete for the same cash, risk budget, exposure limits, and broker
connection.

The V2 Shared-Account Orchestrator solves this by merging independent strategy
proposals into a single account-level portfolio target.

Strategy engines can include:

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Engine Rack</strong> &mdash; proposal sources for one account-level target</summary>

| Engine | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-Sectional Equity Ranker | Selects and weights securities based on alpha scores |
| ETF Macro Allocator | Adjusts broad exposure based on macro and regime signals |
| Risk Overlay Engine | Reduces exposure when drawdown, volatility, or signal quality deteriorates |
| Text-Event Engine | Incorporates LLM-derived event signals into portfolio intent |
| Future Strategy Modules | Additional engines can submit proposals through the same governed interface |

</details>

The orchestrator applies cash constraints, exposure limits, stale-state checks,
throttles, kill switches, reconciliation, and broker-readiness checks before any
target becomes executable.

Deployment is staged:

```text
Shadow Mode -> Paper Trading -> Paper Soak -> Live Preflight -> Controlled Live
```

Nothing becomes live by accident.
Nothing bypasses governance.
Nothing trades without a validated account-level view.

---

## Production Execution Fortress

### Designed to stop before it fails.

The execution layer is built around a conservative principle:

If the system cannot prove it is safe to act, it does not act.

Orders pass through a fail-closed execution path with broker abstraction,
pre-trade validation, state reconciliation, event journaling, and
promotion-state checks.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Safety Matrix</strong> &mdash; proof before action</summary>

| Safeguard | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Fail-Closed Execution | Blocks action when state is stale, invalid, incomplete, or unverifiable |
| Durable Portfolio State | Persists snapshots, parent-child provenance, and account state across restarts |
| Event Journal | Records execution events, promotion events, and operational state transitions |
| Broker Reconciliation | Compares intended portfolio state with broker/account reality |
| Kill Switches | Stops trading when operational or risk conditions become unsafe |
| Order Throttling | Prevents runaway order submission and broker abuse |
| Paper/Live Separation | Keeps simulation, paper, and live paths explicitly separated |
| IBKR Gateway/TWS Integration | Supports broker-backed paper and live execution through controlled adapters |

</details>

The system is not optimized to appear active.
It is optimized to be correct, observable, and controlled.

---

## Governance & Observability Fabric

### The control plane for AI-native trading.

Modern AI systems are expected to be observable, testable, and governable,
especially when agents use tools and interact with external systems. OpenAI&rsquo;s
[Agents](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents),
[Agents SDK tracing](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/),
and [human-in-the-loop](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/human_in_the_loop/)
documentation directly emphasize tools, integrations, observability, guardrails,
and human review as core production concepts.

Quant Platform applies those ideas to systematic trading.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open Governance Console</strong> &mdash; the control plane for AI-native trading</summary>

| Governance Layer | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Feature Registry | Tracks all feature families and their schemas |
| Model Manifest System | Records model versions, feature contracts, prompts, configs, and artifacts |
| Startup Assertions | Prevents production startup when required contracts are missing |
| Readiness Reports | Summarizes whether a strategy is eligible for paper or live progression |
| Promotion Gates | Blocks strategies that fail evidence, risk, or operational requirements |
| Traceable Agent Actions | Makes LLM/agent behavior auditable instead of opaque |
| Human Review Hooks | Allows sensitive transitions to require explicit approval |
| Operator API | Provides controlled visibility into system state and readiness |

</details>

The platform does not trust AI output because it sounds intelligent.
It trusts only what can be measured, replayed, audited, and governed.

## Operating Surface

The installed console script and module entrypoint are equivalent:

```bash
quant-platform --help
python -m quant_platform --help
```


### Manual setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS/Linux/WSL:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Optional extras:

```bash
```

`ibapi` (the IBKR TWS API) is not on PyPI, so no pip extra can provide it.
`scripts/setup.ps1` installs it automatically; to (re)install it on its own:

```bash
pwsh scripts/install_ibapi.ps1            # pinned to API 10.46.1; -Version <ver> to override
bash scripts/install_ibapi.sh             # IBAPI_VERSION=<ver> to override
```

IBKR rotates hosted builds. If the pinned download 404s, pass a current version
from <https://interactivebrokers.github.io/> (for example `-Version 1047.01`).

Optional GPU acceleration for the learned-representations and sequence-ranker
paths installs torch via the `[dl]` extra. PyPI ships CPU-only wheels; install a
CUDA build matching your GPU afterward (example: CUDA 12.8 / cu128):

```bash
```

GPU is optional. Torch-dependent tests skip automatically when CUDA is absent.


## Live IBKR Broker (Native API)

The Docker image deliberately omits `ibapi`, so the containerized API cannot
reach IBKR. To pull live positions/NAV, run the operator API in your venv (where
`ibapi` is installed) on `127.0.0.1` -- which the TWS API trusts by default,
unlike a container's bridge address -- against the Dockerized Postgres + Redis:

```bash
pwsh scripts/serve_api_native.ps1
bash scripts/serve_api_native.sh
```

This ensures `ibapi` is present, starts Postgres + Redis, stops the Dockerized
API to free the port, then serves natively. TWS or IB Gateway must be running
and reachable per the `.env` `QP__BROKER__*` settings (paper TWS = `7497`).

The script also exports `QP__LIVE_IBKR__CONTRACTS_FILE` from `.env` into the
process environment so broker-sync can map account positions (it reads that var
from `os.environ` directly, not pydantic settings) -- point it at your traded
universe, e.g. `infra/config/universe_300.json`, or the console shows 0
positions. On startup the operator API hydrates cash/NAV from the latest
persisted broker snapshot, so the console reflects the real account rather than
the synthetic `--initial-cash` ledger.

## Configuration

Settings are loaded by `PlatformSettings` from `.env` and environment variables
with the `QP__` prefix.

Start from:

```bash
copy infra\config\settings.example.env .env
```

Minimal local in-memory development:

```bash
set QP__STORAGE__POSTGRES_DSN=
set QP__STORAGE__REDIS_URL=
set QP__STORAGE__EVENT_BUS_BACKEND=in_memory
set QP__BROKER__PAPER_TRADING=true
```

Durable paper/live requires at least:

```bash
QP__STORAGE__POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@host:5432/quant_platform
QP__STORAGE__REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
QP__STORAGE__EVENT_BUS_BACKEND=redis_streams
QP__API__OPERATOR_API_KEY=<strong random key>
```

The operator console Strategy screen (strategy runs, engine budgets, source
contributions) is populated by the V2 unified runtime. Enable it so
single-engine supervise runs as the N=1 multi-engine case and writes those rows
(ADR-014); also required by `run-multi-engine`:

```bash
QP__V2__ENABLED=true
QP__V2__ACCOUNT_ORCHESTRATOR_ENABLED=true
```

Common IBKR ports:

| App | Mode | Port |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| TWS | Paper | `7497` |
| TWS | Live | `7496` |
| IB Gateway | Paper | `4002` |
| IB Gateway | Live | `4001` |
